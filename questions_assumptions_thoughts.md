## Clarifying questions
1. Do we have any data on what the most common support tickets or community questions are regarding trigger nodes? If not, then from a support perspective, what are the top 2-3 most common and impactful misconfigurations or misunderstandings users have with triggers that lead to support tickets or workflow failures?
To improve the frequently asked questions section it would be useful to know the trigger type or specific triggers that cause users the most confusion. 

1. When transitioning a workflow between testing and execution, beyond standard HTTPS and basic/header auth, what are the most critical security best practices or vulnerabilities n8n engineers have observed that users should be aware of regarding triggers? I think this document or a supporting page should make users aware of how to secure their triggers, 

1. When a workflow is being activated frequently using one or more triggers are there any rate limit concerns the user should be aware of? If so, I would raise it as a note on the page and link to a topic on rate limiting.

1. The current grouping of trigger nodes under `Other ways` seems quite random and misfit, is there a better way we could organise them so they are more intuitive to locate?

1. What is the best way for users to view logs of their workflows? I can see documentation on [Logging](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/logging-monitoring/logging/) and [Execution data](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) but from a beginner perspective, what is the simplest way to setup and view logs for an a active workflow.

1. Regarding `On app event` triggers, are these only triggered by polling at certain intervals or can they also be triggered by webhooks?
    1. If both polling and webhooks can execute `On app event` triggers then each `On app event` trigger should specify which method is being used or if both are. 
    2. Each `On app event` trigger shoud define/document its polling interval.

1. Is the method I've described under `When called by another workflow` the optimal way to link workflows? Are there other methods for one workflow to trigger another I should be aware of and document?

## Assumptions

1. I have assumed n8n users are somewhat technically proficient and have assumed their knowledge of topics like Cron and Webhooks without explaining these in-depth within the document. 

1. I have assumed in my note box under `On app events` that both polling and webhooks can be used to trigger `On app events`.

## Additional thoughts

1. What analytics are running on the documentation portal? Do we have page metrics from Google Analytics? do we have data on user sessions (using a service like Microsoft Clarity or HotJar). With these we could further analyse where our customers are getting stuck when reading our documentation. 

1. We have a portal where users can showcase custom nodes they've created - [built with n8n](https://community.n8n.io/tags/c/built-with-n8n/15/custom-node). What could we do to increase contributions to this portal and increase community engagement? 

1. Could we improve the AI asistant to help translate natural language queries for trigger types into suggestions for the most appropriate trigger? This would help users find the appropriate trigger from the large selection.

1. Looking back after completing the task, I am happy with the current level of explanation for types of triggers for a introductory page, but it may have been useful to add example triggers for each of the types. My reasoning for not adding them is that this page should maintain a certain brevity and that ideally this would be the first page in a set of documentation for triggers and that examples and indepth explanations of each trigger type could be explored in further docs. 

1. If I was writing a complete set of documentation for this topic, I would organise it as:
    - Introduction to triggers (similar to the current page)
    - Core trigger concepts
    - Example implementations (this page would contain in-depth tutorials for each main trigger type)
    - Configure logs and understand errors
    - Advanced trigger concepts (covering topics like managaing complex workflows and multiple triggers, optimising trigger polling intervals and other perfomance optimisation considerations)
        - For this topic, I would work with n8n engineers to better understand what advanced topics should be covered.
    - Developing custom triggers
